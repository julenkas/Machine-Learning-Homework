0. List of files

all .c files: c source code files
all .h files: c header files
Makefile: file used to compile the code
quick_start.txt: quick instructions from TAs
noisy10_train.ssv: training set
noisy10_valid.ssv: validation set (i.e., pruning set)
noisy10_test.ssv: testing set
read.dt: more detailed usage of this codebase from the original author (only if you are interested)


1. The format of data files (e.g., noisy10_train.ssv)

First three lines are data statistics (#variables plus label, variable names, properties of each variable).
From the 4th line is the data: each line is an example, each column is either the label (the first column) or a variable.


2. To compile the code (in the command line)

make clean
make


3. To run the code (in the command line)

./dt -tpt noisy10_train.ssv noisy10_valid.ssv noisy10_test.ssv


4. Most relevant files to this homework (where you need to make changes)

entropy.c (to write the entropy to compute information gain and pick spliting variable)
prune-dt.c (to write post-pruning strategies)
auxi.h (to change the EPSILON in the pruning rule)
